Created 2 files in week11 and them copy them to ~/lofsdisk
Create ex2.c in week11 and copy to ~/lofsdisk
ex2.c should list every file in root
in bash we need to change the root using chroot to /lofsdisk
and then run ex2.c



Need to copy commands from /bin/bash or /bin/ls (e.g.) to be able to execute them from /lofsdisk (Create folder /lofsdisk/bin and then copy to it bash and ls)

Need to copy shared libraries to /lofsdisk to be able to chroot 
ldd /bin/ls
create folders for each shared library to /lofsdisk
then sudo cp files to /lofsdisk


Copy shared libraries of /bin/bash  and of /bin/ls


sudo chroot ~/lofsdisk ex2
