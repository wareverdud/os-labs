Firstly I changed the input:
2 4
1 1
1 2
2 3
2 2
To the input:
2 4
1 2
1 1
2 3
2 2
And that change decreased hit/miss ratio because the delay between requesting page number 2 increased. 

Secondly I changed the input:
2 5
1 1
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 2
To the input:
2 5
1 1
1 2
2 2
3 4
4 3
In the second example I moved second request of page 2 closer to the first request. So that page 2 was already in the physical memory.

Thirdly I changed the input:
2 5
1 1
1 2
2 2
3 4
4 3
To the input:
2 5
1 1
1 2
2 3
2 4
3 2
That way no change in the ratio happened. That is because even though I moved second request of page 2 as far as possible I changed the time of request to keep the same ratio.
